# ðŸ“Š Visualizing Sequential Queries in Process Mining

This project introduces a framework for **systematically tracking and visualizing the effects of sequential queries** in exploratory process mining. It is designed to support analysts in understanding how each filtering decision shapes their view of the process and to provide transparency throughout the analysis.

## Overview

Process analysts often simplify complex event logs through sequential queries. However, this narrows the dataset and hides the influence of discarded cases. Most tools only retain the final result set, excluding complementary subsets and removing context.

This framework addresses that limitation by:

- Preserving all intermediate subsets generated by queries.
- Computing statistics (e.g., case count, duration) across each branch.
- Visualizing query paths using interactive charts.

## Key Features

- Query lineage tracking across all combinations (2^k subsets)
- Case-level filtering using Boolean predicates
- Metrics for each subset (e.g., average case duration)
- Visualization of query impact and counterfactual paths

## Use Case

Tested on the **BPI Challenge 2017** dataset, the framework supports multi-step filtering (e.g., credit score, loan amount, application type) and reveals how each decision affects the dataset.
