# Visualizing Sequential Queries in Process Mining

This project introduces a framework for systematically tracking and visualizing the effects of sequential queries in exploratory process mining. It is designed to support analysts in understanding how each filtering decision shapes their view of the process and to provide transparency throughout the analysis.

## Overview

Process analysts often simplify complex event logs through sequential queries. However, this narrows the dataset and hides the influence of discarded cases. Most tools only retain the final result set, excluding complementary subsets and removing context.

This framework addresses that limitation by:

- Preserving all intermediate subsets generated by queries.
- Computing statistics (e.g., case count, duration) across each branch.
- Visualizing query paths using interactive charts.
